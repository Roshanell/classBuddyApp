# How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node, Express, Tailwind


# Optimizations:

I'd like to refactor the code in otder to add a purchase log so that accounts with administrative acess can see what was purchased. I'd like to also add a way for administrators to add points to accounts that are made.

# Lessons Learned:

I prefer to work with front end concepts more than back end!

# Examples:

Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:






# Install

`npm install`

---

# Things to add

- Create a `.env` file in config folder and add the following as `key = value`
  - PORT = 2121 (can be any port example: 3000)
  - DB_STRING = `your database URI`
  - CLOUD_NAME = `your cloudinary cloud name`
  - API_KEY = `your cloudinary api key`
  - API_SECRET = `your cloudinary api secret`

---

# Run

`npm start`
